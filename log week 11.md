# what I was trying to do
I tried to read and understand the readings, listen to the podcast and made an attempt at the Archeogaming task.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing
I mean the archeogaming directly ties to the previous work done with the recording of the gravesites.

## what I did

+ Listened to podcast
	+ gained knowledge of what to do for the week and general knowledge about digital archaeology
+ read the readings
	+ basic understanding of reading topics gained
+ Approached the archeogaming task
	+ Viewed the grave monuments found in the hub area of Bloodborne (The Hunter's Dream) in the context of the classification of monuments used for the recording process.

## challenges 
I think the closest thing to a challenge this week was just having to redownload the game and figure out the best way to record the chosen monuments in game.
## thoughts on where to go next
Really just gotta knock this consolidation doc and exit ticket out of the park.
