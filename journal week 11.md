# Introduction 

## Resonances

 "It is difficult to express how uniquely affecting are the methods, processes, sites, artefacts, interpretations, characters, stories, and storytellers borne of the fields of archaeology and cultural heritage." (Perry, 2019)

## Response to the Prompts
Honestly, creative mindsets to the approach of archaeology and history not only allows for innovations on how we make discoveries and maintain and restore artifacts, but also in how we approach the analysis of these items and interpret the past. A lack of open-mindedness continues to stifle the historical narrative when regarding topics such as the denial of the honestly rampant displays of homosexuality found in places and times such as ancient Greece and Rome.
